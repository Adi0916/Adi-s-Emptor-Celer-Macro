# Adi-s-Emptor-Celer-Macro
Mercator Automatus is an AutoHotkey macro designed to automate the process of buying items in the SEEDS and GEARS shops inside the game. It simulates keystrokes and movements to scroll through the shops, confirm purchases, and handle special cases like the 16th item in the GEAR shop.
